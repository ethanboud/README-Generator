## Installation
Download the folder "Develop" as it contains all the necessary files required to run the program.

## Usage
Once downloaded, open the terminal at the "DEVELOP" level and type "node index.js". This will start the application and prompt you with questions to be typed out and answered. After each response, hit "enter" to move on to the next question.

## Contribution
Feel free to add and alter this to fit your needs!

## Test
A test can be ran by simply adding filler text to each section. Upon completion, observe how the filler text is implemented in the generated README file. Run the program again with the desired info for a "final draft". Delete the created README file once done so that a new one can take its place.
